En el presente art{\'\i}culo se destacan varios puntos de inter{\'e}s sobre el inagotable refranero de El Quijote, en particular su actualidad, su importancia y su car{\'a}cter representativo para la lengua espa{\~n}ola de hoy, datos que tienen sin duda una importante aplicaci{\'o}n al {\'a}mbito de la ense{\~n}anza.Entre m{\'a}s de doscientas paremias populares que aparecen en El Quijote, unos 50 refranes han partici- pado en mi estudio sobre la supervivencia del refr{\'a}n espa{\~n}ol y la mayor{\'\i}a de ellos pertenecen a lo que podemos llamar ``m{\'\i}nimo paremiol{\'o}gico espa{\~n}ol'', es decir, el acervo de refranes que necesariamente conoce y usa un joven hablante nativo en Espa{\~n}a.Si los refranes son enunciados que reflejan la realidad de un pa{\'\i}s en un momento determinado de su historia, se puede concluir que la actualidad espa{\~n}ola ha heredado mucho de los personajes inmortales de Miguel de Cervantes.},

This paper brings an ecological perspective to considerations of language survival, maintenance, and well-being. Factors capable of manipulation in a top-down approach to language preservation are considered, including number of speakers, relationships with other languages, patterns of transmission, speakers' attitudes, domains of use, and institutional support. Language preservation is viewed as one aspect of the preservation of linguistic diversity, which in turn constitutes the basis for language regeneration and ultimate well-being.},

Se parte de la idea, expuesta por extenso en Jim{\'e}nez Juli{\'a} (2006 y 2007), de que la aparici{\'o}n de los determinantes como paradigma est{\'a} conectada con su uso como presentadores de unidades tem{\'a}ticas. Los temas son, en principio, unidades con valor sem{\'a}ntico definido, con lo que la utilizaci{\'o}n de determinantes indefinidos no parece adecuada para estos casos. Sin embargo, las frases nominales con determinantes indefinidos no solo se utilizan en posiciones posverbales, sino en muchas ocasiones tambi{\'e}n en las tem{\'a}ticas. La raz{\'o}n de este uso radica en que, en ciertas ocasiones, una unidad con valor indefinido adquiere valores gen{\'e}ricos o contrastivos, esto es, caracterizables como definidos, por razones situacionales o por el contexto ling{\"u}{\'\i}stico inmediato.},

Gender was not statistically related to accuracy.

Anti-bilingual education initiatives have passed easily in California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, while one was closely defeated in Colorado, and federal education policy has re-invigorated the focus on English education for English language learners, while concomitantly obfuscating the possibility of native language maintenance and developmental bilingual educa- tion. This is the educational landscape within which bilingual education researchers, educators, and students must face the formidable challenge of pre- serving educational choice and bilingual education. Thus, substantive research is needed on how bilingual educators navigate this challenging ideological and policy landscape. Based on an ethnographic study of bilingual education lan- guage policy, this article takes up this challenge by focusing on how beliefs about Applied Linguistics research influence the interpretation and appropriation of federal language policy in one US school district. The results have implications for the relationship between the Applied Linguistic research community and language policy processes.},

Despite equal domain general cognitive abilities, Dutch children scored higher than the bilingual children on a L1 vocabulary test, and Moroccan--Dutch children had higher second language (L2) vocabulary skills compared to Turkish--Dutch children. Multigroup analyses revealed strong impact on both L1 and L2 skills of language specific input in literate and oral activities. Finally, indications were found of positive cross-language transfer from L1 to L2 as well as competition between L1 and L2 input.},

This study reexamines this claim by focusing on knowledge of clitic pronouns and word order in 24 L2 learners and 24 Spanish heritage speakers. Results of an oral production task, a written grammaticality judgment task, and a speeded comprehension task showed that, overall, heritage speakers seem to possess more nativelike knowledge of Spanish than their L2 counterparts. Implications for theories that stress the role of age and experience in L2 ultimate attainment and for the field of heritage language acquisition and teaching are discussed.},

year = {2005},
annote = {Los fonemas: son contrastivos. No comparten ning{\'u}n "feature" de significado. 

En espa{\~n}ol solo hay 5 fonemas voc{\'a}licos y menos de 20 fonemas conson{\'a}nticos. 

Suprasegmental/pros{\'o}dico: word stress and tone. En espa{\~n}ol, word stress es fon{\'e}mico/contrastivo. (paso, pas{\'o})

El fonema es una cosa abstracta que utilizamos para generalizar los al{\'o}fonos de un sonido dado. "d" = /d/ = [d] o [ð]

Narrow phonetic transcription: la que aporta mucho non-contrastive detail ej. [kandado] vs. [k{\~a}ɴ̪daðo]
Broad phonetic transcription: incluye solamente unos detalles de particular inter{\'e}s

Complementary distribution: los al{\'o}fonos de un fonema  occur in different contexts: one allophone occurs in a given environment or set of environments and the other is found elsewhere.

For speakers who pronounce /p{\'a}n/ as [paŋ], but /p{\'a}nes/ as [p{\'a}nes], the two sounds [n] and [ŋ] are allophones of /n/ in complementary distribution, since the two sounds occur in different contexts: [ŋ] occurs word-finally and [n] before a vowel.

Free/stylistic variation: the same speaker may pronounce the same phoneme in exactly the same phonological context in more than one way depending, for instance, on the degree of formality in the interaction.

Phonology vs. Phonetics: 
Phonology: The discipline of phonology is primarily concerned with the contrastive units of speech (phonemes) and the patterns in which they are arranged and distributed in different languages. For instance, when we say that /s/ and /z/ are two different phonemes in English and that, furthermore, this pair of segments differs in a feature (the voiceless vs voiced contrast) which is also used systematically to distinguish a whole series of pairs of consonants in this language (/f/ and /v/, /$\theta$/ and <i>/ð/, </i>/p/ and /b/, <i>/t/ and </i>/d/, etc.), we are doing phonology.

Phonetics: 'I'he field of phonetics, on the other hand, deals with the physical aspects of speech sounds. The description of the gestures with the tongue, lips and other articulators involved in the production of different speech sounds is known as AUTICULATORY PHONETICS. With the help of appropriate technology (nowadays mostly software programmes), it is also possible to study the physical characteristics of the sound waves of the different consonants and vowels used in the languages of the world. This is the realm of ACOUSTIC PHONETICS.},

Los consonantes: Consonants are produced by blocking or obstructing in some manner the flow of air coming out from the lungs. Las vocales se producen sin esta obstrucci{\'o}n. 

Active articulator: the organ thatis displaced to make contact with or form a constriction with another articulatory organ, the passive articulator. 

The classification and description: Manner of articulation, place of articulation and activity of the vocal folds. 

Maner of articulation:  the type of obstruction that is created in the articulation of the consonant. 
Plosives/oclusivos: [p t k b d g]
Fricatives/fricativos: [f s x z h $\theta$ ʒ ʃ]
Approximants/aproximantes: [$\beta$ ð ɣ]
Affricates/africado: (two phases, oclusion and fricative) [tʃ]
Nasals/nasales: [ m n ɲ ŋ ]
Laterals/laterales: consonants produced with contact between the articulators along the central axis of the mouth, allowing airflow through one or both sides [ l ʎ ]
Rhotics/vibrantes: [ r ɾ]
*Liquid = laterals and rhotics

Liquids + nasals = sonorant
Plosives + fricatives + affricates = obstruent

Las vocales
For the description of vowels, the main features that are used refer to the position of the tongue body and the shape of the lips. 
Depending on whether the tongue is raised, in neutral position or lowered we have high, mid or low vowels.
Considering the horizontal dimension, we have front, central and back vowels: in the articulation of fronl vowels the tongue body moves towards the front of the mouth, for back vowels the tongue is retracted, and for central vowels it occupies an intermediate postion.
The third feature that is commonly used in the classification of vowels is whether the lips are rounded or spread in the production of the vowel.
I E A O U 

Glides/deslizadas: non-syllabic, occur next to a vowel (either preceding or following it) in the same syllable. Most commonly are high ( [ i̯ ] [ u̯ ] ).
*Some authors refer to semiconsonants when the glide is before the vowel ([ j ] [ w ] "viejo" [bjexo], "pues" [pwes]
and semivowels when they follow the vowel ([ i̯ ] [ u̯ ] "peine" [pei̯ne] "deuda" [deu̯ða]
*It's best to think of them as allophones of the high vowels.

Los procesos fonol{\'o}gicos: any phenomenon that affects the realization of phonemes in specific contexts in a significant way. 

Fonema: contastive sounds in a language

Neutralization: two sounds that are generally found in phonemic opposition fail to contrast in some specific environment.  ( /p/ y /b/ after initial "s" en ingl{\'e}s ). 

European Structuralism: en cuanto a la neutralizaci{\'o}n, se utiliza un archifonema (pj. /N/ = la representaci{\'o}n de los tres fonemas nasales) para representar el resultado de la neutralizaci{\'o}n de dos o m{\'a}s fonemas en un contexto dado. 

Generative fonolog{\'\i}a: en cuanto a la neutralizaci{\'o}n, se utiliza el principio de Underspecification ( = unspecified place of articulation)

Assimilation: the process by which a segment acquires some features from another segment, becoming more similar to it. Consonants and vowels can be both triggers and targets. Normally they are anticipatory. 

YOD: vowel to vowel assimilation. 
Metaphony: the raising of a stressed vowel triggered by a final high vowel.
Vowel harmony: vowel to vowel assimilation in which height, backness/frontness or some other feature triggers assimilation in all the vowel in a given domain (the entire word). 

Dissimilation: a case where a segment becomes more different from another neighboring segment. 

Epenthesis: the insertion of a segment, consonant or vowel. (stress, estr{\'e}s)
Metathesis: the transpostion or interchange of two segments (ej. decir "metathesis")( espadla a espalda)

The results indicate that L2 has a greater influence on the L3 of learners who have had more exposure to their L2. The results also suggest that while L2 proficiency appears to have an impact on the frequency with which L2 intrudes during L3 communication, L2 exposure seems to influence learners' ability to use their knowledge of L2 in order to overcome lexical difficulties in L3. It is also suggested that, unless a threshold level of L2 proficiency is achieved, cross-linguistic influence from L2 on L3 is very marginal.},

An overview of the study of language transfer will be presented, followed by a discussion of the variables that operate and interact when two or more languages come into contact. The variables are categorized as learner-based or language-based, and each is discussed in the contexts of L2 and L3 acquisition. A particular area of focus will be hybrid lexical forms and the unintentional intrusion of L2 items during L3 production.},

The fundamental role of feature theory is to make specific predictions about the kinds of segments and rules that we should find in human languages. One of the main concerns of phonological theory is finding the correct set of features that define the sounds and rule systems of all human languages. },

Stylistic variation: variation in the speech of individual speakers (intra-speaker variation) rather than across groups of speakers (inter-speaker variation). 

Las primeras investigaciones variacionista fueron hechas por Labov. {\'E}ste quer{\'\i}a capturar "casual" speech. Se not{\'o} que las personas hablan de forma m{\'a}s natural cuando no est{\'a}n pendientes de lo que dicen. Cuanto m{\'a}s formal la situaci{\'o}n, m{\'a}s se asemeja su habla al est{\'a}ndar. 

Seg{\'u}n Bell, linguistic variation seems to be a derivative of social class variation. 
Stye axiom: Variation on the style dimension within the speech of a single speaker derives from and echoes the variation which exists between speakers in the "social" dimension. 

Pero... hay excepciones...
Statitical hypercorrection: the use of higher rather than lower levels of standard variants by middle-status groups, than higher-class groups in more formal styles. 
Estas personas suelen show a greater range of variation across speech styles than across social classes. 

Pretons status axiom: Variation on the "status" dimension derives from and echoes the variation which exists within the "linguistic" dimension. (linguistic stereotypes might show unusual behavior, not only in their social class and stylistic patterning but even in their linguistic patterning.)

Limitations in Attention to speech approach: How do you distinguish between casual and careful speech? Tb, this approach views speakers as passive respondants who alter their speech in response to changes in the external situation rather than crediting them with any agency in their use of stylistic resources. Hablan de muchas de las cosas que me preocupaban durante la primera semana. 
 
Otras investigaciones de Bell han demostrado que los speakers cambian su forma de hablar seg{\'u}n les hable.

title = {{Spanish phonology and morphology: a generative view}},
author = {Cressey, WW},
howpublished = {Georgetown Univ Pr},
year = {1978},
annote = {1) each rule changes few features of segments to which it applies
2) each rule applies across a word boundary as well as within words
3) each rule is subject to a cetain amount of variation
4) all of the rules can be ordered near the end of the phonological component
5) all of the rules are productive; they apply to new words which are coined or borrowed from other languages

Nasal and lateral assimilation: a nasal which is followed directly by another consonant becomes homorganic with that consonant. This assimilation takes place within words and across a word boundary unless a phonetic phrase boundary (pause) occurs between the two words. 

Laterals also assimilate to the point of articulation of a following consonant provided the consonant has a point articulation which a lateral can assume. 

Problems with this (4):
1) The condition of bi-uniqueness is seen to be incorrect
2) The need is shown for a formal equivilent of the term homorganic
3) Some of further evidence is provided for the definition of the feature  "oclusive"
4) A special use of redundancy rules is suggested to account for the fact that lateral assimilation applies over a more restricted range of points of articulation than does nasal assimilation.

Es cambio tiene que ver con el uso del verbo estar en situaciones en las que se suele utilizar el verbo ser ( ser + adjetivo ). El autor cree haber aportado pruebas a favor de la hip{\'o}tesis de que "language contact situations can accelerate linguistic changes". Los datos indican claramente que hay un cambio en marcha dentro de esta comunidad, y este movimiento lo encabeza las mujeres que no terminaron sus estudios secundarios. 

d{\'o}nde? Michoacan, M{\'e}xico
las variables: edad (llevaban desde los 5 a{\~n}os ah{\'\i}), menos de 30, entre los 30 y los 50 y mayor de los 50,
formaci{\'o}n: incomlete elem., incomplete sec., tech. y college education.

el verbo ser/estar + adjetivos: 
hay tres tipos de adjetivos
1) sustantivo-intr{\'\i}nseco (naturaleza)
2) relativo-extr{\'\i}nseco (caracter{\'\i}stico adquirido)
3) activo (actions and behaviors of the subject, naturaleza?)

Seg{\'u}n Silva-Corval{\'a}n, el uso inovador de estar es un ejemplo de cambio en marcha debido al hecho de que son los hablantes m{\'a}s jovenes los que m{\'a}s realizan este uso (representan el porcentaje m{\'a}s alto).

lifestage and history: eso qu{\'e} es?

-un hablante respresenta a su vez un lugar en la historia y una etapa de la vida

-Age stratification de variable ling{\"u}{\'\i}sticas pueden reflejar el cambio del habla de una comunidad a medida que {\'e}sta avanza en el tiempo (cambio hist{\'o}rico), Y el cambio del habla del individuo seg{\'u}n {\'e}ste avanza en la vida (age grading). 

-Hay resolver la ambig{\"u}edad entre age grading and change in apparent time.
-Para esto, tenemos que tener en cuenta lo siguiente:
to what extent, and in what ways, puede cambiar el habla de un hablante durante his life course? How are these changes embeddedin like stages and life events? and to what extent does age interact with other social variable such as class, gender, and ethnicity? 
-Para las respuestas, hay que entender LINGUISTIC LIFE COURSE

2 Apparent and Real Time
Grossly combines age figures can mask specific group effects. 

3 Approaches to Age
Chronological age vs. age
define cohorts: etically vs. emically 
etic: group speakers in arbitrarily determined but equal age spans, such as decades. 
emic: group speakers according to some shated experience of time. (puede estar relacionado con una etapa de la vida o con la historia, ej. childhood, adolescence, young adulthood etc.)

4 The linguistic life course
4.1 Childhood
No s{\'o}lo aprenden de sus padres
La naturaleza del input linguistico (how much time spent with peers, and in what activities) que reciben los ni{\~n}os puede variar mucho across certain social boundaries such as class, gender, and ethnicity. 
4.2Adolescence
Como etapa de la vida, es algo espec{\'\i}fico de la sociedad industrial y la era moderna. 
De particular inter{\'e}s, durante la adolescenc{\'\i}a, los que se est{\'a}n convirtiendo en adultos are normatively denied adult roles, and isolated from the adult sphere in institutions of secondary education. 
-Estilo se convierte en algo importante (el libro habla de cool kids) 
-Linguistic change from belowis advanced (cambio desde abajo)
-mucho sound change y uso de vernacular variables... pq? pq ellos engange in constructiing identities in opposition to/independiently of their elders. 
4.3 Adulthood
La etapa de vida m{\'a}s conservadora
5 Cohorts, Genertions, Eras

We should get away from chronological age and move towards the life experiences that give age meaning.

In order to investigate the relationship between production and perception of these two vowel pairs, the first experiment compared the acoustic and perceptual characteristics of the /i/--/e/ and /u/--/o/ contrasts within each of the two languages. In order to investigate the responses of listeners to non-native stimuli, the second experiment presented native listeners of English and Spanish with synthetic /i/--/e/ and /u/--/o/ stimuli that were modeled after natural vowels as spoken by speakers of the other language. The results indicated a close production-perception link, as well as a degree of flexibility of the perceptual vowel space in response to stimuli that are structured around non-native vowel category locations. These results suggest that listeners perceive vowel stimuli with reference to a specific phonemic vowel system, and, if necessary, will adjust their perceptual vowel system to match the stimuli. Additionally, a comparison of the absolute locations of the /i/--/e/ and /u/--/o/ perceptual boundaries across the two languages indicated the presence of universally preferred, inventory-independent boundary locations.},

annote = {Music has a unique ability to trigger memories, awaken emotions and to intensify our social experiences

We do not need to be trained in music performance or appreciation to be able to reap its benefits-already as infants, we relate to it spontaneously and effortlessly

the way in which the abstract shapes and patterns of musical sound can have such profound meaning to us remains elusive.

Here we review recent neuroimaging evidence and suggest that music, like language, involves an intimate coupling between the perception and production of hierarchically organized sequential information, the structure of which has the ability to communicate meaning and emotion.

We propose that these aspects of musical experience may be mediated by the human mirror neuron system.

It has recently been proposed that music is best understood as a form of communication in which acoustic patterns and their auditory representations elicit a variety of conscious experiences (Bharucha et al., 2006).

we review some recent evidence on the neural basis of musical processing in relation to two other modes of communication, language and action, both of which have been described as supported by the human mirror neuron system.

We hypothesize that the powerful affective responses that can be provoked by apparently abstract musical sounds are supported by this human mirror neuron system, which may subserve similar computations during the processing of music, action and linguistic information.

The mirror neuron system has been proposed as a mechanism allowing an individual to understand the meaning and intention of a communicative signal by evoking a representation of that signal in the perceiver's own brain.
	-described in both area F5 of the premotor cortex and in parietal area PF of the macaque brain 
	-discharge both when the monkey performs an action and when it observes another individual perform a similar action
	-It has been suggested that parietal mirror neurons have the special property of coding motor acts as belonging to an action sequence, predicting the intended goal of a complex action
	-subsets of premotor mirror neurons have been shown to have audiovisual properties, and are able to represent actions independently of whether they are performed, heard or seen

A similar fronto-parietal network, including the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), adjacent ventral premotor cortex and the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), appears to subserve related functions in the human brain

studies have now shown that such a human fronto-parietal mirror neuron system is engaged during action observation and imitation

frontal mirror neuron region has also been shown to be involved in understanding the intentions behind the actions of others

there is some recent evidence to suggest that, as in the monkey, the human mirror neuron system shows sensitivity to auditory stimuli related to actions

a range of current evidence suggests that a human fronto-parietal mirror neuron system shows proper- ties consistent with the ability to represent the actions and intentions of others, across modalities, by recruiting one's own motor system.

parallels between the activity of mirror neurons recorded in the monkey and human neuroimaging findings are established primarily in the domain of action observation/execution.
	- However, functions of this neural system have recently been linked to several high-level human cognitive functions such as empathy (Carr et al., 2003; Gallese, 2003b; Dapretto et al., 2006), theory-of-mind (Williams et al., 2001, 2006) and self-other discrimination (Uddin et al., 2005, 2006).

A notion of shared representa- tions for production and perception of speech has been previously proposed and formalized in the Motor Theory of Speech Perception (Studdert-Kennedy et al., 1970; Liberman and Mattingly, 1985; Liberman and Whalen, 2000). This theory holds that two-way communication is based on shared representation and occurs when sender and perceiver co-activate this representation. Mirror neurons may provide the neural basis of this shared representation between sender and perceiver, which Liberman postulated as the necessary prerequisite for any type of communication

this perception-action link is supported by an automatic and non-conscious simulation mechanism, whereby one uses the same neural resources to represent and understand the actions of others as to perform one's own actions 

Such a neural system allows one, in essence, to experience the mind of the other, or as the expression would have it, to `walk in another's shoes'.

La relaci{\'o}n con la m{\'u}sica????
music has always been associated with motor activity.
the production of music involves well- coordinated motor actions that produce the physical vibrations of sound. The experience of music thus involves the perception of purposeful, intentional and organized sequences of motor acts as the cause of temporally synchronous auditory information. Thus, according to the simulation mechanism implemented by the human mirror neuron system, a similar or equivalent motor network is engaged by someone listening to singing/drumming as the motor network engaged by the actual singer/drummer; from the large-scale movements of different notes to the tiny, subtle movements of different timbres. This allows for co-representation of the musical experience, emerging out of the shared and temporally synchronous recruitment of similar neural mechanisms in the sender and the perceiver of the musical message. This shared musical representation has a similar potential for communication as shared language or action.

The connection between music and motor function is evident in all aspects of musical activity􏰀we dance to music, we move our bodies to play musical instruments, we move our mouths and larynx to sing.

A number of recent neuroimaging studies have shown that specific musical experience or expertise can modulate the activity within the fronto-parietal mirror neuron system (Haslinger et al., 2005; Bangert et al., 2006), as can dancing experience (Cross et al., 2006) and music-related motor learning (Buccino et al., 2004; Calvo-Merino et al., 2004).

Music, of course, is a communicative signal comprised of patterns whose performance and perception are governed by combinatorial rules, or a sort of musical grammar 

the auditory signal is not simply organized in consecutive sequential elements, but involves hierarchical relationships. 

Hierarchical organization is the process of integrating lower-level units to form more complex higher- level units and in the case of music this involves combinations of both sequential and simultaneous elements such as notes, rhythms, phrases, chords, chord progressions and keys to form an overall musical structure

Human language is a communicative signal with a similar hierarchical structure, in which phonemes are combined to form words, phrases and sentences up to the discourse level of speech structure

Such principles of hierarchical organization also underlie other complex abilities such as problem-solving (Newell and Simon, 1972) and tool-use (Greenfield, 1991; Greenfield et al., 2000).

In the musical domain, damage to this area of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus can lead to the conjoint impairments of aphasia and amusia􏰀a selective problem with perceiving and interpreting music (Alajouanine, 1948). (comparar con los efectos de las afasias y el habla)

Recent evidence has also shown that aphasic patients with syntactic comprehension difficulties in language exhibit similar syntactic difficulties in the domain of musical harmony (Patel, 2005).

Neuroimaging studies of language function and studies of sensory-motor integration have shown evidence of an overlap between the brain regions involved in linguistic processing and regions comprising the human mirror neuron system 

In accordance with these findings, neuroimaging studies have shown that Broca's area and its right-hemisphere homologue supports the processing of syntax in both language (Dapretto and Bookheimer, 1999; Friederici et al., 2000a, 2000b) and music 

In parallel with the developmental literature on action and language, infants also seem to show implicit knowledge of principles of hierarchical organization for music, for example they are able to distinguish different scales and show preferences for consonant over dissonant tonal combinations

The proposal of a common neural substrate for music, language and motor functions is supported by evidence from studies of language disorders
	children with dyslexia exhibit specific timing difficulties in the domain of music, motor control y language
	music lessons with dyslexic children can lead to improvements in language skills
	patients with severe non-fluent aphasia can benefit from Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), a highly imitative speech therapy technique based on singing.

The success of music/speech therapy methods such as MIT might thus be due, at least in part, to the fact that their imitative elements involve a direct transfer of sensory information to a motor plan, leading to a strong recruitment and co-activation of brain regions involved in the perception and production of both music and language.

The range of research findings discussed so far lends support to the hypothesis that the perception of action, language and music recruit shared neural resources, which appear to be located in brain regions comprising the human mirror neuron system

Based on this evidence, we propose that humans may comprehend all communicative signals, whether visual or auditory, linguistic or musical, in terms of their understanding of the motor action behind that signal, and furthermore, in terms of the intention behind that motor action.

The expressive nature of any human action or vocalisation sends a signal of the intentional and emotional state of the executor, such that even footsteps can be correctly interpreted as conveying simple emotions (such as sad, happy, angry or stressed) 

Thus, as a sentence or a musical phrase can be used to express an individual's semantic intention or emotional state, a listener can understand the intended expression of the sentence or melody, via the perceived `motion' of the signal.

Since the acoustic nature of music can convey pure, non-referential `motion' in pitch-space and time, it can thereby convey complex and subtle qualities of human `e'motion, using varying complexities of structural hierarchy.

one of the defining features of music is its ability to induce an emotional response in listeners

one of the main reasons people give for listening to music is to experience or modulate their emotional state

Emotional responses to music are present in early life and across cultures (Balkwill and Thompson, 1999), indicating that the ability to perceive emotions in music may be innate 

Numerous measures of autonomic arousal have been used to investigate the emotion-inducing effects of music. Skin conductance responses appear to be useful indicators of musically induced emotional arousal and `chills' (goosebumps) can be elicited when participants are allowed to select music they find arousing 

Emotion, especially as communicated by the face, the body and the voice is an active motor process. Emotion and action are intertwined on several levels, and this motor- affective coupling may provide the neural basis of empathy

it appears that the mirror neuron system is involved not only in the intersubjective representations of actions but also in emotion􏰀representations that allow us to feel connected with other agents.

It has been suggested that the perception of emotion in music may arise in part from its relation to physical posture and gesture 

It has also been shown that expressive music can induce subliminal facial expressions in listeners

and these in turn may induce subjective and physiological emotional expressions

As posture, gesture and facial expressions are important implicit cues in social communication, one can easily imagine that `musical gesture' can have similar effects in communicating emotions.

With its ability to link perceptual and behavioral representations of a stimulus during the percep- tion of emotionally arousing music, the mirror neuron system may simulate an emotional state in the listener

Thus, in the case of music, the human mirror neuron system and the limbic system may communicate through the insula to provide an automatic representation of the musical stimulus (figura 1)

In conclusion, we propose here that in its ability to integrate and represent cross-modal information, the mirror neuron system may provide a domain-general neural mechanism for processing combinatorial rules common to language, action and music, which in turn can communicate meaning and human affect.

Although it is yet to be determined which specific aspects of processing linguistic, musical or motor syntax may recruit frontal mirror neuron regions, the emerging picture from the literature suggests that the mirror neuron system provides a neural substrate for representing infinite combinations of hierarchical structures, a computation that may underlie more general cognitive abilities.},

abstract = {This dissertation investigates the realization and interpretation of information structure in Spanish. Focused constituents may appear in the right-periphery, in the left-periphery or in situ in Spanish. Recent studies have addressed the relative weight of syntactic and phonological cues in the realization of information structure, but have not adequately accounted for these three types of focus. Syntax-based accounts, asserting that focused phrases move to the left-periphery to check features, fail to account for focus in the right-periphery. So-called prosody-based accounts, which in fact depend on the syntactic requirement that focus has to be aligned with nuclear stress, are unable to account for focus in a position other than final. Experimental data from a pilot study reported in this dissertation suggest that prominence in all three types of focus is determined by a prosodic structure without syntactic motivation. Focal prominence is signaled by high pitch peaks in Spanish, and elements in final position are always realized with high peaks regardless of the information status of the final element. This suggests that a distinction between unmarked and marked stress is required, corresponding to information focus and contrastive focus respectively. Further, differences in semantic interpretation support the view that three different focus types exist in Spanish: contrastive (in the left-periphery) contrastive (in situ) and information (in the right-periphery). I provide evidence that information focus does not have a focus feature, but in contrast, I show that movement to the left periphery of all contrastive phrases always applies, either overtly or covertly, for feature checking purposes. The possibility of contrastive focus appearing in situ is prosodically licensed. In such cases, movement to the left periphery applies at LF as supported by the fact that contrastive phrases in situ show weak crossover effects. More broadly, this dissertation contributes to the general discussion of the Syntax-Phonology interface. The above results suggest that a prosodic structure mediates between the Syntax and the Phonology, supporting the view that phonological processes must be accessed by the syntactic component before Spell-Out.},

abstract = {This paper addresses beginning level Spanish heritage language (SHL) learners' attitudes towards their language and culture. Heritage language (HL) programs and research have often overlooked beginning level learners, especially within university settings. The current study involved 20 participants from a beginning level SHL class in the Southwestern United States. Participants completed a lengthy survey addressing the issues of language contact, language attitudes and linguistic behaviors. Follow-up interviews were also conducted. The results observed confirm previous research. The majority of students seldom use Spanish with parents, grandparents or relatives (79%); however, their responses indicate they are frequently surrounded by Spanish, with ample opportunities to overhear the language. Student goals include overcoming a lack of confidence in Spanish as well as a desire to improve fluency. Students' answers demonstrate a high degree of motivation to study Spanish. Our results attest to the fact that the specific needs, attitudes, and rich cultural background of the Southwest's beginning heritage students parallel those of more advanced students in this region in university HL programs, indicating a need to create a space for these students within such programs. We conclude our paper with pedagogical guidelines based on our results and specifically tailored to this population of students. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The main objective of this article is to provide new evidence regarding the impact of bilingualism on the attentional system. We approach this goal by assessing the effects of bilingualism on the executive and orienting networks of attention. In Experiment 1, we compared young bilingual and monolingual adults in a numerical version of the Stroop task, which allowed the assessment of the executive control network. We observed more efficient performance in the former group, which showed both reduced Stroop Interference and larger Stroop Facilitation Effects relative to the latter. Conversely, Experiment 2, conducted with a visual cueing task in order to assess the orienting network, revealed similar Cueing Facilitation and Inhibition (Inhibition of Return {\^a}€`` IOR) Effects for both groups of speakers. The implications of the results of these two experiments for the origin and boundaries of the bilingual impact on the attentional system are discussed.},

abstract = {This might seem like an unusual topic, as most scientists seem to know exactly what a PhD is and for what it stands. But on closer inspection, a PhD has as many meanings as there are educational systems. It is not---and has never been---a single, well-defined qualification. As research practices and funding change, the situation becomes even more confused, with consequences for the quality of both scientific training and research.

I received my PhD from a British university. After three years of research, I sub-mitted a three-centimetre-thick thesis that addressed a specific problem. Being awarded my doctorate meant that I knew my topic, I understood enzymology, I could work with proteins and I was able to navigate the complexities of enzyme kinetics. I was not qualified for the title until I was able to demonstrate all these things. In essence, my PhD showed that I developed from a dependent student into an independent scientist.

Since then, PhDs in the UK seem to have changed. More often than not, a PhD is now awarded after the completion of a fixed term of research. Of course, there is an overall topic, but if the student does not reach a hypothesis-based conclusion within a timeframe of about three years, this is no longer a hindrance to earning the degree. Increasingly, the thesis has become a report with an emphasis on training rather than the detailed description of a scientific project.},

abstract = {La producci{\'o}n de la vibrante m{\'u}ltiple supone uno de los retos m{\'a}s complicados a los que se tiene que enfrentar el alumno de espa{\~n}ol como L2 (E/L2). Partiendo de la investigaci{\'o}n de Luque Delgado (2008), el presente estudio de caso analiz{\'o} los efectos de las t{\'e}cnicas de respiraci{\'o}n asociadas con el canto y algunas t{\'e}cnicas de terapia articulatoria, como herramientas para mejorar la realizaci{\'o}n de la vibrante m{\'u}ltiple en posici{\'o}n intervoc{\'a}lica de un aprendiz tard{\'\i}o de E/L2 durante un periodo de nueve semanas. Tras el mencionado periodo de investigaci{\'o}n, se vio que el informante realiz{\'o} la vibrante m{\'u}ltiple con una duraci{\'o}n m{\'a}s corta, con m{\'a}s sonoridad y con menos fricci{\'o}n.Se sugiere la realizaci{\'o}n de una investigaci{\'o}n controlada que aplique modelos estad{\'\i}sticos de an{\'a}lisis de varianza (ANOVA) para poder determinar, por separado, la eficacia de las presentes t{\'e}cnicas respecto al mejoramiento de la vibrante m{\'u}ltiple en estudiantes de E/L2.},

abstract = {An ubiquitous phenomenon in psychology is the `repetition effect': a repeated stimulus is processed better on the second occurrence than on the first. Yet, what counts as a repetition? When a spoken word is repeated, is it the acoustic shape or the linguistic type that matters? In the present study, we contrasted the contribution of acoustic and phonological features by using participants with different linguistic backgrounds: they came from two populations sharing a common vocabulary (Catalan) yet possessing different phonemic systems. They performed a lexical decision task with lists containing words that were repeated verbatim, as well as words that were repeated with one phonetic feature changed. The feature changes were phonemic, i.e. linguistically relevant, for one population, but not for the other. The results revealed that the repetition effect was modulated by linguistic, not acoustic, similarity: it depended on the subjects' phonemic system.},

DRT - 1980s, an alternative to MT - the direct realist theory (DRT) of speech perception - developed by Carol Fowler, at the Haskins Laboratories - Like MT, DRT claims that the objects of speech perception are articulatory rather than acoustic events. - However, unlike MT, DRT asserts that the articulatory objects of perception are actual, phonetically structured, vocal tract movements, or gestures, and not events that are causally antecedent to these movements, such as neuromotor commands or intended gestures. - DRT also contrasts sharply with MT in denying that specialized (i.e., speech-specific or human-specific) mechanisms play a role in speech perception. - Instead, following the general theory of direct perception, Fowler argues that speech perception can be broadly characterized in the same terms as, for example, visual perception of surface layout. - MT and DRT both claim that the objects of speech perception are gestures (intended in the case of MT, actual in the case of DRT), advocates of the two theories cite some of the same empirical findings as supporting evidence GA - In contrast to MT, GA does not invoke special mechanisms or modules to explain speech perception. - Rather, it assumes, as a working hypothesis, that speech sounds are perceived using the same mechanisms of audition and perceptual learning that have evolved in humans or human ancestors to handle other classes of environmental sounds. - In contrast to MT and DRT, GA assumes that listeners' recovery of spoken messages from the acoustic signal (whether these messages are construed as distinctive features, phonemes, words, or some higher-level linguistic units) is neither equivalent to nor mediated by the perception of gestures. Categorical perception - The results of comparing speech and nonspeech perception and speech perception in humans and nonhumans strongly indicate that general auditory mechanisms (common to human adults and infants, other mammals, and even birds) contribute to the categorical perception of speech sounds. - language experience is also a significant factor in categorical perception. Lisker \{\&}amp; Abramson (1970, Abramson \{\&}amp; Lisker 1970) found cross-language differences in identification boundaries and discrimination peaks - In organizing their sound systems, languages exploit natural boundaries, but, within limits, they also modify them. Stimulus length effect - The perceptual assessment of temporal cues for certain phoneme distinctions is known to depend on the duration of nearby regions of the acoustic signal - COMPENSATION FOR COARTICULATION - Perception appears to compensate for the effects of coarticulation. - LEARNING SPEECH AND NON SPEECH CATEGORIES - how listeners come to perceive sounds in a manner that is particular to their native language. - a listener must discriminate acoustic variance in the speech signal that is linguistically relevant and to generalize across variance that is irrelevant. - what counts as relevant and irrelevant depends on the phoneme inventory of the specific language - Exposure to regularities within a natural language is proposed to lead to a reorganization of perception in terms of phoneme categories or equivalence classes- From a DRT perspective, Best (1993, 1995) has offered the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) - according to which the initial discriminative abilities of infants are due to the direct recov- ery of the individual simple articulations that produce the sounds. - With exposure to a language, infants begin to group coordinated gestures that are related to the phonemes of the language into equivalence classes. - proposal by Kuhl (1991, 1993, 2000) that experience with speech sounds leads to the creation of category prototypes or high-density representations of exemplars that act as ``perceptual magnets'' that warp the perceptual space. RELATION BETWEEN SPEECH PRODUCTION AND PERCEPTION - MT and DRT assume that there exists a very close relationship between speech production and perception: Talkers produce gestures and listeners perceive them (or, in the case of MT, they perceive the intended gestures). - Accordingly, regularities of speech production (e.g., context dependencies in the realization of successive phonemes) should be highly correlated with listeners' perceptual judgments. - data assures us that such a correlation exists - GA differs from MT and DRT on how the correlation is to be explained. - Production follows perception, and perception follows production. - The first of these is meant to subsume cases in which the need for auditory distinctiveness of phonemes shapes production. - The other claim ofGAis that perception follows production. According to GA, listeners do not recover gestures, but they do perceive the acoustic consequences of gestures. MAIN CHALLENGES MT - the empirical case for MT must ultimately rest on demonstrations of patterns of performance that are specific to speech perception by humans. - we examined some of these phenomena, including categorical perception and several phonetic context effects, and concluded that they were not, in fact, unique to speech or to human listeners. - A main challenge for motor theorists, therefore, is to offer more compelling evidence of genuine speech- and human-specific perceptual performance. DRT - Do acoustic signals uniquely specify the prop-erties of sound sources such as the vocal tract? The answer appears to be no. - many different ways to produce a given speech signal - the same formant pattern can be achieved either by rounding the lips, lowering the larynx, or doing a little of both - a major challenge for DRT is to offer a credible solution to the inverse problem (mapping speech signals onto vocal tract shapes that produced them) that does not rely on prior knowledge of the human vocal tract. GA - its too new - a major challenge forGA is to develop hypotheses based on far more accurate information about the auditory representation of speech and the statistical properties of natural speech.

Introducci\'{o}n Prop\'{o}sito: Evaluar la discriminaci\'{o}n de vocales inglesas por parte de hispanohablantes expuestos al ingl\'{e}s a una edad temprana (aprendices tempranos). Motivaci\'{o}n: Se desconoce hasta qu\'{e} punto se mantiene la plasticidad del sistema de percepci\'{o}n despu\'{e}s de haberse establecido el sistema fonol\'{o}gico de la L1 durante el desarrollo infantil temprano. Los beb\'{e}s empiezan a percibir el habla de su L1 de una manera espec\'{\i}fica durante el primer a\~{n}o de vida, desminuyendo as\'{\i} su sensibilidad a los contrastes que no son fon\'{e}micos en su L1 Se ha propuesto que se debe a una p\'{e}rdida de plasticidad neuronal que se da a medida que se maduran las neuronas (normal neural maturation) Como resultado la adquisici\'{o}n de la L2 se ve afectada por la adquisici\'{o}n del sistema fonol\'{o}gico de la L1 Native Language Magnet Theory (NLM): Durante el primer a\~{n}o de la vida, las clases fon\'{e}ticas establecidas de la L1 act\'{u}an como imanes perceptuales que distorsionan el input auditivo. A medida que se desarrolla el mapa perceptual, la identificaci\'{o}n de los sonidos de la L1 mejora, y, a su vez, se dificulta la percepci\'{o}n y el establecimiento de nuevas categor\'{\i}as en una L2. Estudios que apoyan la NLM: Bosch et al., 2000; Sebasti\'{a}n-Gall\'{e}s et al., 2005; Pallier et al., 1997, 2001) No obstante, ha habido estudios que demuestran lo contrario cuando los aprendices usan su L1 con poca frecuencia (Flege et al., 1999; Flege y MacKay, 2004). La presente investigaci\'{o}n Estudios anteriores han evaluado la plasticidad perceptual comparando a los aprendices tempranos con nativos de la L2 en cuesti\'{o}n Este estudio compara no s\'{o}lo entre aprendices tempranos y nativos de la L2 (ingl\'{e}s), sino tambi\'{e}n entre aprendices tempranos y nativos de la L1 (espa\~{n}ol) aprendices tempranos/nativos de la L2 = aprendizaje perceptual completo o no? aprendices tempranos/nativos de la L1 = cu\'{a}nto se ha aprendido? Experimento I Prop\'{o}sito: Desarrollar un experimento de percepci\'{o}n tipo AXB en el que los participantes obtengan puntuaciones perfectas (o casi) si las vocales se perciben como fonemas distintos y puntuaciones aleatorias (near-chance scores) para los participantes que perciben las vocales extranjeras como ocurrencias de una sola categor\'{\i}a de la L1. Phoneme Perception Theory (PPT): Existen tres procesos para la codificaci\'{o}n de los est\'{\i}mulos sacados de un conituo de sonidos Labeling: the trace is mapped onto the permanent context and is given a phonetic label (``phoneme label'') Context (position) coding: the trace is mapped onto the experimental context. trace coding: the sensory trace is stored with all acoustic information intact, but decays rapidly after a few hundred milliseconds Seg\'{u}n esta teor\'{\i}a, las vocales percibidas como fonemas distintos utilizan labeling y las vocales que reciben el mismo label (withing-category contrasts) tienen que discriminarse mediante context coding o trace coding. Para evitar el uso de context codes se han hecho dos modificaciones: Block structure - para limitar la capacidad de recordar los context codes Varios bloques separados seg\'{u}n el contraste o... Un bloque largo que presenta todos los est\'{\i}mulos de manera aleatoria Variaci\'{o}n de la F0 - para desviar la atenci\'{o}n de modo que no se fijen en las dimensiones que indiquen la categor\'{\i}a de la vocal baja alta neutra: todas altas o todas bajas; no sugiere la respuesta correcta ni la incorrecta incongruente: mezcla; sugiere la respuesta incorrecta ej.

abstract = {Phonetic variation has been considered a barrier that listeners must overcome in speech perception, but has been proved beneficial in category learning. In this paper, I show that listeners use within-speaker variation to accommodate gross categorical variation. Within the perceptual learning paradigm, listeners are exposed to p-initial words in English produced by a native speaker of French. Critically, listeners are trained on these words with either invariant or highly-variable VOTs. While a gross boundary shift is made for participants exposed to the variable VOTs, no such shift is observed after exposure to the invariant stimuli. These data suggest that increasing variation improves the mapping of perceptually mismatched stimuli.},

abstract = {This study assessed the effect of English-language experience on non- native speakers production and perception of English vowels. Twenty speakers each of German, Spanish, Mandarin, and Korean, as well as a control group of 10 native English (NE) speakers, participated. The non-native subjects, who were first exposed intensively to English when they arrived in the United States (mean age"25 years), were assigned to relatively experienced or inexperienced subgroups based on their length of residence in theUS (M"7.3 vs. 0.7 years). The 90 subjects accuracy in producing English /i >2 / was assessed by having native English- speaking listeners attempt to identify which vowels had been spoken, and through acoustic measurements. The same subjects also identified the vowels in synthetic beat-bit (/i/-/>/) and bat-bet (/ /-/2/) continua. The experienced non-native subjects produced and perceived English vowels more accurately than did the relatively inexperienced non-native subjects. The non-native subjects degrees of accuracy in producing and perceiving English vowels were related. Finally, both production and perception accuracy varied as a function of native language (L1) background in a way that appeared to depend on the perceived relation between English vowels and vowels in the L1 inventory.},

Although interlingual identification exerts a powerful influence on L2 pronunciation, it is still poorly understood. Orthographic classification was used here to assess the interlingual identification of Spanish and English vowels. Sixty native speakers of Spanish in three experiments judged the vowels /i/, /I/, /e/, and /ae/ in multiple tokens of English words ("beat", "bit", "bet", "bat") spoken by ten native speakers of American English. The subjects labelled each English vowel by circling one of the five letters used to spell the vowel phonemes of Spanish (viz. less than i greater than, less than e greater than, less than a greater than, less than o greater than, less than u greater than) or by circling "none" if they thought they had heard a vowel not found in Spanish. Subjects who spoke English as an L2 used the "none" label more often than did Spanish monolinguals, suggesting that L2 learning heightens bilinguals' awareness of cross-language phonetic differences. Experienced Spanish speakers of English did use the "none" label more often than did inexperienced subjects (42% vs. 18%). A few subjects used the "none" label consistently for /ae/ and /I/, suggesting that they may have regarded these vowels as "new" (i.e., non-Spanish). However, the group data provided little support for the hypothesis that the adult Spanish learners of English treated either /ae/ or /I/ as new. The great majority of subjects, even those highly experienced in English, identified English /ae/ with their Spanish /a/.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend the classic study of vowel acoustics by Peterson and Barney (PB) [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 24, 175-184 (1952)]. Recordings were made of 45 men, 48 women, and 46 children producing the vowels /i,I,e, epsilon,ae,a, [symbol: see text],O,U,u, lambda,3 iota/ in h-V-d syllables. Formant contours for F1-F4 were measured from LPC spectra using a custom interactive editing tool. For comparison with the PB data, formant patterns were sampled at a time that was judged by visual inspection to be maximally steady. Analysis of the formant data shows numerous differences between the present data and those of PB, both in terms of average frequencies of F1 and F2, and the degree of overlap among adjacent vowels. As with the original study, listening tests showed that the signals were nearly always identified as the vowel intended by the talker. Discriminant analysis showed that the vowels were more poorly separated than the PB data based on a static sample of the formant pattern. However, the vowels can be separated with a high degree of accuracy if duration and spectral change information is included.},

An additional goal was to estimate the correlation between their discrimination and production of these vowels. Participants (40 bilingual Spanish- and English-speaking and 40 native monolingual English-speaking college students, 23-3 6 years of age) participated (M age 25.3 yr., Mdn = 25.0). The discrimination and production of English vowels in real and novel words by adult participants bilingual in Spanish and English were examined and their discrimination was compared with that of 40 native monolingual English-speaking participants. Stimuli were presented within triads in an ABX paradigm. Novel words were chosen to represent new words when learning a new language and to provide a more valid test of discrimination. Bilingual participants' productions of vowels were judged by two independent listeners to estimate the correlation between discrimination and production. Discrimination accuracy was significantly greater for native English-speaking participants than for bilingual participants for vowel contrasts and novel words. Significant errors also appeared in the bilingual participants' productions of certain vowels. Earlier age of acquisition, absence of communication problems, and greater percentage of time devoted to communication contributed to greater accuracy in discrimination and production.

abstract = {This study examined the production and perception of English vowels by highly experienced native Italian speakers of English. The subjects were selected on the basis of the age at which they arrived in Canada and began to learn English, and how much they continued to use Italian. Vowel production accuracy was assessed through an intelligibility test in which native English-speaking listeners attempted to identify vowels spoken by the native Italian subjects. Vowel perception was assessed using a categorial discrimination test. The later in life the native Italian subjects began to learn English, the less accurately they produced and perceived English vowels. Neither of two groups of early Italian/English bilinguals differed significantly from native speakers of English either for production or perception. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of the speech learning model [Flege, in Speech Perception and Linguistic Experience: Theoretical and Methodological Issues (York, Timonium, MD, 1995)] that early bilinguals establish new categories for vowels found in the second language (L2). The significant correlation observed to exist between the measures of L2 vowel production and perception is consistent with another hypothesis of the speech learning model, viz., that the accuracy with which L2 vowels are produced is limited by how accurately they are perceived.},

Elman and McClelland (1988) provided evidence for such top-- down processing by showing that a prelexical process (compensation for coarticulation) could be affected by lexical activation. However, Pitt and McQueen (1998) reported that the observed compensation effects were in fact due to the transitional probability of certain phonemic sequences, rather than lexical activation. Part I of the current study shows that perceptual grouping must be considered in assessing compensation effects, reopening the question of whether lexical activation can drive compensation. Part II shows that when perceptual grouping is taken into account, lexically mediated compensation can indeed be observed, confirming the interactive nature of speech processing.

abstract = {The present study reports on an acoustic analysis of alveolar laterals in two contact languages (Catalan and Spanish) as produced by two groups of Catalan--Spanish bilinguals (Catalan-dominant and Spanish-dominant) residing on Majorca. Catalan alveolar laterals have been reported to be ``darker'' (i.e. velarized) than Spanish ones. Recent sociophonetic research has suggested that Catalan and Spanish are gradually converging in this phonetic feature due to intensive contact and that laterals are sociolinguistically salient in Majorca. This paper examines the potential interactions between the social-indexical role of laterals in Majorca and the abilities of bilinguals to maintain two separate acoustic distributions for laterals in their two languages. First, it is shown that bilinguals tend to transfer the phonetic features of the sound categories of their native language to their non-native one even after having had early and extensive exposure to native input in their non-dominant language. Second, it is shown that while most bilinguals maintain two separate acoustic distributions for the laterals in their two languages, some participants do not. Social-indexical and cognitive factors that could explain this finding are discussed.},

abstract = {Performance-based studies on the psychological nature of linguistic competence can conceal significant differences in the brain processes that underlie native versus nonnative knowledge of language. Here we report results from the brain activity of very proficient early bilinguals making a lexical decision task that illustrates this point. Two groups of Spanish-Catalan early bilinguals (Spanish-dominant and Catalan-dominant) were asked to decide whether a given form was a Catalan word or not. The nonwords were based on real words, with one vowel changed. In the experimental stimuli, the vowel change involved a Catalan-specific contrast that previous research had shown to be difficult for Spanish natives to perceive. In the control stimuli, the vowel switch involved contrasts common to Spanish and Catalan. The results indicated that the groups of bilinguals did not differ in their behavioral and event-related brain potential measurements for the control stimuli; both groups made very few errors and showed a larger N400 component for control nonwords than for control words. However, significant differences were observed for the experimental stimuli across groups: Specifically, Spanish-dominant bilinguals showed great difficulty in rejecting experimental nonwords. Indeed, these participants not only showed very high error rates for these stimuli, but also did not show an error-related negativity effect in their erroneous nonword decisions. However, both groups of bilinguals showed a larger correct-related negativity when making correct decisions about the experimental nonwords. The results suggest that although some aspects of a second language system may show a remarkable lack of plasticity (like the acquisition of some foreign contrasts), first-language representations seem to be more dynamic in their capacity of adapting and incorporating new information.},

abstract = {Behavioral studies have shown that while young infants can discriminate many different phonetic contrasts, a shift from a language-general to a language-specific pattern of discrimination is found during the second semester of life, beginning earlier for vowels than for consonants. This age-related decline in sensitivity to perceive non-native contrasts has been generally attested in monolinguals. In order to analyze the impact of bilingual exposure on the perception of native-sound contrasts and the early building of language-specific contrastive categories, four-month-old and eight-month-old infants from Spanish monolingual, Catalan monolingual and Spanish-Catalan bilingual environments have been tested with a familiarization-preference procedure on a vowel contrast present only in Catalan: /e/-/epsilon/. As expected, younger infants were all able to perceive this contrast, independently of the language of exposure. However, by eight months, only infants from Catalan monolingual environments succeeded. Although the decline in sensitivity with the monolingual Spanish group was expected, the results with the bilingual group challenge the view that mere exposure is enough to maintain the capacity to perceive a contrast. An additional experiment at 12 months of age indicated that bilinguals finally regained discrimination. Together these results suggest a specific developmental pattern of perceptual reorganization in bilingual exposure.},

abstract = {It is well attested that we perceive speech through the filter of our native language: a classic example is that of Japanese listeners who cannot discriminate between the American /l/ and /r/ and identify both as their own /r/ phoneme (Goto. H., 1971. Neuropsychologia 9, 317-323.). Studies in the laboratory have shown, however, that perception of non-native speech sounds can be learned through training (Lively, S.E., Pisoni, D.B., Yamada, R.A., Tohkura, Y.I., Yamada, T., 1994. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 96 (4), 2076-2087). This is consistent with neurophysiological evidence showing considerable experience-dependent plasticity in the brain at the first levels of sensory processing (Edeline, J.-M., Weinberger, N.M., 1993. Behavioral Neuroscience 107, 82-103; Merzenich, M.M., Sameshima, K., 1993. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 3, 187-196; Weinberger, N.M., 1993.

Outside of the laboratory, however, the situation seems to differ: we here report is study involving Spanish-Catalan bilingual subjects who have had the best opportunities to learn a new contrast but did not do it. Our study demonstrates a striking lack of behavioral plasticity: early and extensive exposure to a second language is not sufficient to attain the ultimate phonological competence of native speakers.},

abstract = {The language environment modifies the speech perception abilities found in early development. In particular, adults have difficulty perceiving many nonnative contrasts that young infants discriminate. The underlying perceptual reorganization apparently occurs by 10-12 months. According to one view, it depends on experiential effects on psychoacoustic mechanisms. Alternatively, phonological development has been held responsible, with perception influenced by whether the nonnative sounds occur allophonically in the native language. We hypothesized that a phonemic process appears around 10-12 months that assimilates speech sounds to native categories whenever possible; otherwise, they are perceived in auditory or phonetic (articulatory) terms. We tested this with English-speaking listeners by using Zulu click contrasts. Adults discriminated the click contrasts; performance on the most difficult (80% correct) was not diminished even when the most obvious acoustic difference was eliminated. Infants showed good discrimination of the acoustically modified contrast even by 12-14 months. Together with earlier reports of developmental change in perception of nonnative contrasts, these findings support a phonological explanation of language-specific reorganization in speech perception.},

abstract = {To investigate the interaction in speech perception of auditory information and lexical knowledge (in particular, knowledge of which phonetic sequences are words), acoustic continua varying in voice onset time were constructed so that for each acoustic continuum, one of the two possible phonetic categorizations made a word and the other did not. For example, one continuum ranged between the word dash and the nonword tash; another used the nonword dask and the word task. In two experiments, subjects showed a significant lexical effect--that is, a tendency to make phonetic categorizations that make words. This lexical effect was greater at the phoneme boundary (where auditory information is ambiguous) than at the ends of the condinua. Hence the lexical effect must arise at a stage of processing sensitive to both lexical knowledge and auditory information.},

In behavioral tests assessing their memory for Korean, we found that they do not perform better than a control group of native French subjects who have never been exposed to Korean. We also used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor cortical activations while the Korean adoptees and native French listened to sentences spoken in Korean, French and other, unknown, foreign languages. The adopted subjects did not show any specific activations to Korean stimuli relative to unknown languages. The areas activated more by French stimuli than by foreign stimuli were similar in the Korean adoptees and in the French native subjects, but with relatively larger extents of activation in the latter group. We discuss these data in light of the critical period hypothesis for language acquisition.},

abstract = {Languages differ widely in the size of their vowel inventories; however, cross-linguistic surveys indicate that certain vowels and vowel system configurations are preferred. A cross-linguistic comparison of the acoustic vowel categories of two languages that differ in vowel inventory size, namely, English and Spanish, was performed in order to reveal some of the language-specific and/or universal principles that determine the acoustic realization of the vowels of these two languages. This comparison shows that the precise location in the acoustic space of similar vowel categories across the two languages is determined, in part, by a language-specific base-of-articulation property. These data also suggest that the relatively crowded acoustic vowel space of English may be expanded with respect to the relatively uncrowded acoustic vowel space of Spanish; however, this effect is variable depending on the syllable context of the English vowels. Finally, the data indicate no difference in the tightness of within-category clustering for the large versus the small vowel inventory.},

abstract = {Also appears in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, in press. The lang environment modifies the speech perception abilities found in early development: adults have difficulty perceiving many nonnative contrasts that young infants discriminate. The underlying perceptual reorganization apparently occurs by 10-12 months. According to one view, it depends on experiential effects on psychoacoustic mechanisms. Alternatively, phonological development has been held responsible, with perception influenced by whether the nonnative sounds occur allophonically in the native lang. It was hypothesized that a phonemic process appears around 10-12 months, which assimilates speech sounds to native categories whenever possible; otherwise, they are perceived in auditory or phonetic (articulatory) terms. This was tested with Eng-speaking listeners, using Zulu click contrasts. Adults (N = 17) discriminated the click contrasts; performance on the most difficult (80% correct) was not diminished even when the most obvious acoustic difference was eliminated. Infants (N = 40) showed good discrimination of the acoustically modified contrast even by 12-14 months. Together with earlier reports of developmental change in perception of nonnative contrasts, these findings support a phonological explanation of lang-specific reorganization in speech perception. 8 Tables, 4 Figures, 58 References.

abstract = {This study assessed the relation between non-native subjects' age of learning (AOL) English and the overall degree of perceived foreign accent in their production of English sentences. The 240 native Italian (NI) subjects examined had begun learning English in Canada between the ages of 2 and 23 yr, and had lived in Canada for an average of 32 yr. Native English-speaking listeners used a continuous scale to rate sentences spoken by the NI subjects and by subjects in a native English comparison group. Estimates of the AOL of onset of foreign accents varied across the ten listeners who rated the sentences, ranging from 3.1 to 11.6 yr (M = 7.4). Foreign accents were evident in sentences spoken by many NI subjects who had begun learning English long before what is traditionally considered to be the end of a critical period. Very few NI subjects who began learning English after the age of 15 yr received ratings that fell within the native English range. Principal components analyses of the NI subjects' responses to a language background questionnaire were followed by multiple-regression analyses. AOL accounted for an average of 59% of variance in the foreign accent ratings. Language use factors accounted for an additional 15% of variance. Gender was also found to influence degree of foreign accent.},

Ganong (1980) demonstrated that a category boundary shift occurs when the voiced end of 1 voice-onset time continuum is a word but the voiceless end of another series is a word; this is known as the "lexical effect." A series of studies was undertaken to examine how lexical neighborhood; in contrast to lexical status, might influence word perception. Pairs of nonword series were created in which the voiced end of 1 series had a higher frequency-weighted neighborhood density, whereas the reverse was true for the other series. Lexical neighborhood was found to affect word recognition in much the same way as lexical status.},

annote = {A bottom-up approach towards the clarification of the general functional relevance of Broca's area comes from the study of mirror neurons in monkeys (Rizzolatti and Fadiga, 1998). The idea of a cortical mirror system that codes action has recently been expanded from visual action observation to audiovisual and purely auditory domain (Kohler et al., 2002; Keysers et al., 2003; Romanski and Goldman-Rakic, 2002).

Three studies in musicians point towards a musical mirror system, one using auditory (Ohnishi et al., 2001), the second using visual (Hasegawa et al., 2004), and the third using auditory and visual action-observation (Haslinger et al., 2005).

What makes the auditory mirror system hypothesis particularly interesting is that the classic notion of Broca's area being dedicated to language and speech processing is now being expanded to cover a broad range of stimuli---including music.

compartment of the cortex classically associated with language production may be involved in more general types of sensorimotor processing. The network recruited by professional musicians for listening to music as well as for performing musical actions may have properties of a transmodal mirror system.},

Consistent with past acoustic studies, subjects produce /b/ with incomplete closure phrase medially and complete closure phrase initially. Additionally, /b/ is shorter than /p/ phrase medially though not initially. For /b/, though not for /p/, there is a correlation between constriction degree and duration, consistent with the theory of dynamical undershoot. The results from the study are accurately modeled with a virtual target for /b/ slightly beyond the point of articulator contact. Such a target results in full closure at long durations (such as found phrase initially) and incomplete closure at shorter durations. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that /b, d, g/ differ from /p, t, k/ in three ways:},

In two preliminary experiments, Italian university students who had lived in Canada for 3 months were found to have difficulty discriminating because they often identified both members of each contrast as instances of a single Italian vowel. The participants in two other experiments, long-time residents of Canada, were assigned to groups based on their age of arrival in Canada from Italy (early vs. late) and percentage of first language (L1) use (high L1 use vs. low L1 use). Experiment 3 focused on the discrimination of , and experiment 4 examined the discrimination of correct from incorrect realizations of . In both experiments, the early learners obtained higher discrimination scores than the late learners, and low-L1-use participants obtained higher scores than high-L1-use participants. Most important, the early learners who used Italian often (early high), but not the early learners who used Italian seldom (early low), were found to differ from native speakers of English in perceiving English vowels. These results suggest two important conclusions regarding second language (L2) perceptual learning: Learning an L2 in childhood does not guarantee a nativelike perception of L2 vowels, nor does the establishment of a sound system for the L1 preclude a functionally nativelike perception of L2 vowels. Another important finding is that, although the late learners generally perceived English vowels less accurately than the early learners, some perceived them accurately.

Measure the respondents willingness or commitment to perform a particular type of behavior, without actually performing it. -Matched guise: technique used to measure group evaluation reactions to particular languages, varieties, racial populations, ect.-Judges have no knowledge of who the speaker is. -can be used to measure prejudice, personal attitudes, group preference, degree of bilingualism etc. - the benefits: control over voice quality, content of the text, personality of the speaker - the technique is highly adaptable ex. Kimple (1968) 'Mirror image' technique CITAS "...people who construct 'attitude scales' rarely maintain that their instruments are measuring these components; instead they usually contend that their scales indicate people's evaluation (pro-con) of objects or concepts. Thus, although attitudes are often said to include all three components, it is usually only the evaluative or 'the affective component' that is measured and treated by researchers as the essence of attitudes." ibid},

The subjects listened to a stimulus tape containing short speech segments, some using [tʃ] and other using [ʃ], and then indicated whether they considered the individual to be a professional or a laborer. The subjects were then given a Likert-type attitude survey questioning their acceptance or rejection of the allophone [ʃ]. The results of the two tests reveal that the subject group does not see the use of [ʃ] for [tʃ] as wrong or unacceptable. They indicate that lexicon is the most important consideration in determining the social status of a given speaker. Pronunciation is the next most important factor, followed by syntax. Comparisons of [ʃ] acceptance are based on biographic information provided by the subjects. Finally the subject group considers the use of [ʃ] as a diatopic marker for Northen Mexican Spanish, with several subjects indicating that the use of [ʃ] is the principal reason for arriving at this conclusion.},

These cities were selected based on their high or low exposure of the US culture (that is, high exposure is assumed if the city was close to the US border and / or coastal city). We used Tajfel ' s Theory to hypothesize the relationship between spokesperson ' s accent and consumers ' purchase intentions in that location. The theory posits that the most infl uential spokesperson will be the person who speaks with the standard accent for a given region but what is considered standard accent changes based on cultural infl uences of different groups. To test the hypothesized relationships, we used a sample of 1058 student subjects who observed an advertisement with different accented spokespersons. Consistent with the theory, the results of this study indicate that consumers that are less exposed to the US culture (inland Mexico cities) had more favorable views about the spokesperson that had an MSA than a spokesperson with an ASA. Moreover, consumers in the cities close to the US border and coastal areas had equally favorable views for both accents. The implications for the marketers are discussed.},

In the survey, respon- dents are required to rate source credibility by applying items gathered from previous studies. To overcome inconsistencies and weaknesses of previous factor model studies, a rigorous analysis of the source credibility concept based on an extraction of a series of measurements is performed. Furthermore, an analysis procedure with various steps in order to ensure reliability and validity is applied to the data. The selected procedure led to a consistent and integrative solution of three highly discriminant main dimensions of source credibility in marketing communication. The three dimensions can be referred to as the inclination toward truth, the potential of truth and the presentation. Findings are discussed and methodological, theoretical and managerial implications are highlighted.},

Under low task importance, heuristic processing of the credibility cue was the sole determinant of Ss' attitudes, regardless of argument ambiguity or strength. When task importance was high and message content was unambiguous, systematic processing alone determined attitudes when this content contradicted the validity of the credibility heuristic; when message content did not contradict this heuristic, systematic, and heuristic processing determined attitudes independently. Finally, when task importance was high and message content was ambiguous, heuristic and systematic processing again both influenced attitudes. Yet, source credibility affected persuasion partly through its impact on the valence of systematic processing, confirming that heuristic processing can bias systematic processing when evidence is ambiguous. Implications for persuasion and other social judgment phenomena are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

When people weremade aware of the source of their difficulty they were able to correct when the accent was mild but not when it was heavy. This effect was not due to stereotypes of prejudice against foreigners because it occurred even though speakers were merely reciting statements provided by a native speaker. Such reduction of credibility may have an insidious impact on millions of people, who routinely communicate in a language which is not their native tongue.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation of the relationship between communicator physical attractiveness and source credibility within a marketing context is reported. Source credibility measures involved perception of trust, expertise, and liking as a function of experimental treatments that differed in only the physical attractiveness of the communicator. Communicator physical attractiveness is operationally defined as the degree to which a person's face is pleasing to observe, and is determined through a consensus of judges. The marketing context involved persuasive communications presented in a printed advertisement mock-up. Generally, the hypotheses were supported by the results of the data analyses. Monotonic relationships were found between communicator physical attractiveness and (a) perceived trust, (b) perceived expertise, and (c) liking for the communicator.},

		- un operador liga dos variables y tb "huecos par{\'a}sitos" en los que una variable est{\'a} legitimada por la presencia de otra.

CONCLUSI{\'O}N: la gram{\'a}tica de la negaci{\'o}n no es tan especial como se tend{\'\i}a a pensar. Las propiedades de las oraciones negativas pueden ser analizadas mediante principios existentes.

p. 167
La negaci{\'o}n no hab{\'\i}a recibido mucha atenci{\'o}n pq no pod{\'\i}a ser explicada mediante las herramientas que ten{\'\i}an en esa {\'e}poca. Sale la idea de las proyecciones funcionales y Bosque (y unos cuantos m{\'a}s: Longobardi en italiano y Mortiz y Valois en franc{\'e}s) se da cuenta de que puede explicarse de manera semejante a la que se usa para explicar la palabras qu-. 
Lo fundamental: 
1) la negaci{\'o}n es un n{\'u}cleo que encabeza su propia proyecci{\'o}n
2) la negaci{\'o}n es un operador con un determinado {\'a}mbito

Con estas dos ideas se pueden explicar muchas de las particularidades de las frases negativas.

El problema: Dar cuenta de las diferencias entre CCNN y TPN
CCNN: cuantificadores negativos (No)
TPN: t{\'e}rminos de polaridad negativa (Nadie)
ej. No vino nadie. Nadie (*no) vino.

En los 80, Bosque dec{\'\i}a que hab{\'\i}a "una transformaci{\'o}n" que antepon{\'\i}a el TPN (como en "Nadie vino") y a su vez "borraba" el "no". 

AN{\'A}LISIS de LAKA p. 169
Hay una proyecci{\'o}n SigmaP (sigma frase). Su n{\'u}cleo es un operador negativo. Este n{\'u}cleo est{\'a} representado por el operador "no" en una secuencia de TPN postverbal y es un elemento vac{\'\i}o una secuencia TPN preverbal.

p. 169
De esta propuesta, Bosque saca lo siguiente:
los TPN preverbales ocupan la posici{\'o}n del especificador de una proyecci{\'o}n encabezada por la negaci{\'o}n, a la que se mueven desde su posici{\'o}n can{\'o}nica.
PROBLEMA{\ldots} no es suficiente para contestar dos preguntas{\ldots}
1) ¿Las condiciones que hay que cumplir para que quede legitimado un TPN postverbal?
2) ¿C{\'o}mo se mide la distancia entre un no preverbal y un TPN postverbal?},

abstract = {The Spanish voiced alveolar multiple vibrant consonant /r/, or trill, is often regarded as one of the most difficult sounds in the Spanish phonological inventory for second language (L2) learners. Trills are particularly difficult segments because of their exacting articulatory requirements for production. The highly restricted gestural and aerodynamic configuration required to successfully produce trills could lead to non-native trills automatically being native-like once acquired by learners, unlike other segments which generally show measurably gradient approximation of native values over time. This study employed two experiments to investigate the characteristics of L2 acquisition of Spanish /r/ by adult native speakers of English. The first experiment broadly surveyed the frequency of trill production at four levels of proficiency and among a comparison group of native speakers of Mexican Spanish when trills were the target segments in words. This experiment was designed to show the rate of trill frequency at different learner-levels and to compare it with the rate at which native speakers produce trills. A pattern of increasing ability to produce trills as proficiency level increased was found, as was a pattern of substitution of the alveolar tap as an intermediate strategy among learners who had ceased to transfer American English r but who had not yet acquired the ability to produce trills consistently. The second experiment investigated the aerodynamic properties of successfully produced trills to see if the trills of learners who had acquired the ability to produce trills displayed different physical properties from native speakers' trills. Patterns of both "categorical" and "gradient" acquisition were found. On the several measures studied, non-native trills showed patterns of acquisition in which their trills either were immediately native-like, acquired with non-native-like properties which fossilized with no further improvement, or showed gradient improvement in the direction of nativeness as proficiency level increased.},
